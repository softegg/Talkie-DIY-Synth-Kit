# Talkie-DIY-Synth-Kit
 Talkie is a DIY Handheld Virtual Analog Music Synthesizer Kit designed by Tina Belmont for the X-Days 2025 event at X-Hain hack+make space, Friedrichshain, Berlin.
 
 This project is based on the Vectorscope Synth ( https://github.com/softegg/Vectorscope-Synth ) made for a Hackaday Berlin 2024 workshop, which was based on the Stylish Trucker Belt Buckle Music Synthesizer ( https://github.com/softegg/Stylish-Trucker-Belt-Synthesizer ) originally made for MAGwest in 2018. Please find the Arduino source code in those projects.
